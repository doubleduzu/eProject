            <p class="tieu-de-lon text-center">[Graphic Design] Redesign Logo Challenge</p>
            <p> On a busy life, have you accidentally seen problematic designs? It can be font errors, unacceptable colors, or a logo that doesn't understand what the author's intention is. Once you are already a <b>design practitioner and</b> live by the
                profession of design , the unpleasant feeling of seeing a faulty work is a feeling that can be said to be frequent.</p>
            <p> And with Emanuele Abrate, a designer from Italy, he embarked on redesigning problematic logos instead of just feeling uncomfortable about them. Let's take a look at the new look of these logos after they have been edited!</p>
            <p><b>1. Instituto de Estudos Orientais</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/1_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> This is perhaps the most famous example of a logo with vague messages and misleading images.</p>
            <p> The designer still wants to keep the space negative and enhance the shape of the temple. The selected font is converted to San-serif to better fit the icon.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/1_2.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/1_3.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>2. Kudawara Pharmacy</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/2_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> The problem with this logo is poor use of typical styles, disproportionate elements, and last but not least, shapes that create an unclear message.</p>
            <p> The designer removed all the elements, keeping only the use of K-characters and color palettes.</p>
            <p> The letter K has been built with simple blocks and creates a sense of trust associated with nature. In negative spaces, you can also see a cross-factor that represents the pharmaceutical and medical sectors.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/2_2.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/2_3.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>3. Computer Doctors</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/3_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> With this logo, Designers want to work on a whole new concept.</p>
            <p> Based on the message of the brand "Computer Doctor" designed to show the content of health care for computer devices. The idea behind the logo is the shape of the screen, taking advantage of the negative space inside the cross icon, in a different
                perspective you can see the first 2 letters of the brand "C", "D".</p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/3_2.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p><b>4. Arlington Pediatric Center</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/4_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> The new logo starts from the same concept, but re-explains it in a way that eliminates any misunderstandings and gives a more confident feel. Simple shapes with circles bring friendliness and smiles of the characters.</p>
            <p> Typical styles are also replaced by a more modern Sans-serif font.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/4_2.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/4_3.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p class="text-center"><b>5. Mama's Baking</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/5_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> Inspired by the image of her mother's rice bowls and her passion for cooking, Designer started with the oven as a symbol combined with a heart that conveys love and passion for cooking. Looking at it as a real chef's hat, the "chubby" typewriter
                was chosen to represent a mother who is somewhat pushing the momentum to always take care of each meal for her children.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/5_2.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/5_3.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/5_4.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>6. Clinica Dental San Marcelino</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/6_1.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> At first glance at the logo many people will wonder if this is a dental care service or a charming club? The illustration of this logo is easily misunderstood by customers. The designer decided to come up with a new, simpler and easier-to-understand
                solution.
            </p>
            <p> The letters "C" and "D" are arranged to form a smiling face. A clean design with circles and blue creates a sense of trust and friendliness.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/6_2.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/6_3.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>7. Fire Prevention Products</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/7.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> It's unclear what the logo's message is, viewers will only see something burning "underneath???</p>
            <p> The original logo was not able to transmit the content as desired, so the Designer decided to create a completely different image. With a red circle surrounded by itself like a fire in negative space. The abbreviation of the brand "FPP" is
                placed inside to easily identify the brand even if the full name is not displayed.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/7_1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/7_2.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>8. Safe Place</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/8.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> There are really too many problems in this logo, the cubes are integrated together to create a cramped, broken feeling. Besides, the illustration does not feel as safe as the name, instead appears a little disturbing.</p>
            <p> The designer decided to clean it all up, remove all the excess, the image of the house is the only element that is retained and raised. Look at the fruits of simplifying things!</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/8_1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/8_2.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p><b>9. OGC (Office of goverment Commerce</b></p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/9.png" alt=""></p>
            <p> OGC is a logo that seems to be nothing wrong, it's an acronym with three sans-serif letters placed very close together, but when rotating along the logo you can see the image a pretty embarrassing one, and certainly this is not a good look
                for a government agency.</p>
            <p> For this reason, the Designer decided to rely on the previous logo itself to perform a restructuring to improve the view.</p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/9_1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/img/news_image/Graphic-Design/9_2.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p> Each logo has been upgraded to a new look with a clearer, more modern message. What do you think of this change? If you are you, what better idea do you have for the above cases?</p>
