                <p> On September 20, 2020, the Center for Information Technology – University of Natural Sciences organized a Graduation Project <b>Report for</b> Machine <b>Learning students.</b></p>
                <p> These are students who have completed 6 Machine Learning Certificate subjects in 9 months with 5 reported topics. All topics have high practical application and clear future project development orientation. </p>
                <p> The council was <b>attended by Mr. Dang The Khoa –</b> Deputy Director of The Center for Information Technology, <b>Ms. Re Thi Hanh –</b> Deputy Director of The Center for Information Technology and <b>Mr. Nguyen Quan Liem – Lecturer who directly guided the project.</b></p>
                <p> Opening the report is speech <b>accent recognition project - Predicting Nationality through the voice of</b> Ngo Ha Gia <b>Bao</b>- a student of Machine Learning <b>Certificate class.</b> With five weeks of implementation, the project
                    has completed and predicted the Nationality of English voices from three countries, the UNITED Kingdom, Vietnam and China, giving accurate results in a short time and high accuracy.</p>
                <p> The project is highly practical, scalability and application in language conversion and translation systems, making it faster and smoother to translate into another language.</p>
                <p class="text-center img-fluid"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3.png" alt=""></p> <br> <br>
                <p> Gia Bao is a web programmer, seeing many development opportunities in the field of Machine Learning, you have chosen to study this new field. Steady programming knowledge also helps you quite a lot in accessing new technology.</p>
                <p> Next, your report duc <b>Huy</b> with the topic Logo Detection - Logo recognition on <b>the prduct.</b> The goal of the topic is to identify the logo attached to the product image of which brand. The topic makes logo verification easier,
                    frees up manual labor, helps provide early product information to reject infringement requests, and images containing brand logos that don't match product brands. The topic is highly practical, especially for e-commerce businesses.</p>
                <p class="text-center img-fluid"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3-1.png" alt=""></p> <br> <br>
                <p> Duc Huy is a final year student in Biomedical Engineering, seizing the opportunity to access new technologies and desire to apply technology to health, develop your career after graduation, so you have chosen to take <b>the Machine Learning Certificate course.</b></p>
                <p> A topic that is being applied more and more in large enterprises in our country and around the world, is <b>Face Identification.</b> We have heard of face authentication in ATM transactions, point of absence - timesheet by face or closer
                    to young people is facial recognition on smartphones today. All are applications of the facial authentication system.</p>
                <p class="text-center img-fluid"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3-2.png" alt=""></p> <br> <br>
                <p> Xuan Khoi's topic was evaluated clearly and fully by the Council, the demo part was carefully prepared, lively, quick identification speed with an accuracy of over 95%.</p>
                <p> Next is the topic <b>Image Retrieval - Query with your</b> image Anh <b>Tu</b> . This topic is often used in e-commerce businesses, social networking sites use images such as instagram, tiktok, Pinterest, Flickr, used to give the results
                    of similar images when users need to query images. The demo is prepared quite thoughtfully, which gives high-precision results.</p>
                <p class="img-fluid text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3-3.png" alt=""></p>
                <p>Although starting from the economic sector, Anh Tu is very difficult to explore, research, learn <b>more selenium - Test Automation to</b> emy user action, match the results, produce more reliable results. </p>
                <p> And finally, the topic Name Entity Recognition - Entity recognition in your sentence Tai Tue. The objective of the topic is to build a system to identify names, landmarks and products in a sentence. This supports the processing of natural

                <p class="img-fluid text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3-4.png" alt=""></p>
                <p> The project report took place well, the topics all showed high practicality and application, expressing their understanding of technology and technology knowledge. With only a period of five weeks, but the topics fully implement the process
                    of a Machine Learning project, testing and bringing solutions, oriented to improve in the future quite well.</p>
                <p class="img-fluid text-center"><img src="/img/news_image/data-science-image/bao-cao-do-an-tot-nghiep-machine-learning-khoa-3-0.png" alt=""></p>
                <p>Congratulations on completing the <b>Machine Learning Certificate program</b> at the Center for Computer Science - University of Natural Sciences. Wish you continue to grow with open opportunities in the future.</p>
